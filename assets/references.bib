   abstract                      = {The aim of this research essay is to examine the structural nature of theory in Information Systems. Despite the importance of theory, questions relating to its form and structure are neglected in comparison with questions relating to epistemology. The essay addresses issues of causality, explanation, prediction, and generalization that underlie an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies information systems theories with respect to the manner in which four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction, and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished: (1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type of theory under development can influence the choice of an epistemological approach. Support is given for the legitimacy and value of each theory type. The building of integrated bodies of theory that encompass all theory types is advocated.},

The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

   abstract                      = {Use of machine learning (ML) in clinical research is growing steadily given the increasing availability of complex clinical data sets. ML presents important advantages in terms of predictive performance and identifying undiscovered subpopulations of patients with specific physiology and prognoses. Despite this popularity, many clinicians and researchers are not yet familiar with evaluating and interpreting ML analyses. Consequently, readers and peer-reviewers alike may either overestimate or underestimate the validity and credibility of an ML-based model. Conversely, ML experts without clinical experience may present details of the analysis that are too granular for a clinical readership to assess. Overwhelming evidence has shown poor reproducibility and reporting of ML models in clinical research suggesting the need for ML analyses to be presented in a clear, concise, and comprehensible manner to facilitate understanding and critical evaluation. We present a recommendation for transparent and structured reporting of ML analysis results specifically directed at clinical researchers. Furthermore, we provide a list of key reporting elements with examples that can be used as a template when preparing and submitting ML-based manuscripts for the same audience.},
