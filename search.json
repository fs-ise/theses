    "text": "Topic sentences\nTopic sentences provide clarity and structure, making it easier for readers to follow the argument. They are commonly found in high-quality academic writing. Good examples of topic sentences can be found in top-tier journal papers like the one by Davis (1989):\n\nPerceived usefulness and perceived ease of use\nWhat causes people to accept or reject information technology? Among the many variables that may influence system use, previous research suggests two determinants that are especially important. First, people tend to use or not use an application to the extent they believe it will help them perform their job better. We refer to this first variable as perceived usefulness. Second, even if potential users believe that a given application is useful, they may, at the same time, believe that the system is too hard to use and that the performance benefits of usage are outweighed by the effort of using the application. That is, in addition to usefulness, usage is theorized to be influenced by perceived ease of use.\nPerceived usefulness is defined here as “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance.” This follows from the definition of the word useful: “capable of being used advantageously.” Within an organizational context, people are generally reinforced for good performance by raises, promotions, bonuses, and other rewards (Pfeffer, 1982; Schein, 1980; Vroom, 1964). A system high in perceived usefulness, in turn, is one for which a user believes in the existence of a positive use-performance relationship.\nPerceived ease of use, in contrast, refers to “the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort.” This follows from the definition of “ease”: “freedom from difficulty or great effort.” Effort is a finite resource that a person may allocate to the various activities for which he or she is responsible (Radner and Rothschild, 1975). All else being equal, we claim, an application perceived to be easier to use than another is more likely to be accepted by users.",

    "title": "Error prevalence in academic search queries: An analysis using an automated validation tool",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Thesis Advisor: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner\nSummary: Literature search queries used to access scientific databases often contain syntactic errors and inconsistencies. Since such errors can adversely affect the effectiveness of reviews, their detection and prevention are critical steps in query formulation, use and reporting. Due to the length and complexity of queries, manual validation is often impractical, which has prompted the development of automated solutions. Building on these advances, this thesis performs a comprehensive evaluation of academic search queries using the query validation tool, search-query. The analysis aims to identify common pitfalls and inconsistencies, addressing both syntactic errors (e.g., unbalanced parentheses) and opportunities for refinement (e.g., removal of redundant components). A dataset of queries taken from searchRxiv will be compiled for the analysis. The dataset will include queries for the popular search platforms Web of Science, PubMed, and EBSCOHost. The evaluation will also serve to assess the functionality of the search-query tool and reveal potential areas for improvement in its design.\nMethods: The thesis combines design science and quantitative approaches, proceeding in three phases: 1) Creating of a test dataset of queries based on searchRxiv. 2) Analyzing the queries using the search-query package. 3) Preparing and evaluating the test data and suggesting improvements to the tool’s design.\nExpected Outcomes: This thesis will provide a comprehensive evaluation of academic search queries used in peer-reviewed research. The analysis will offer statistical insights into the prevalence of different error types and structural characteristics of the queries. A deeper understanding of common patterns can support error prevention and the formulation of more effective search strategies. The evaluation will also verify the functionality of the search-query tool and highlight potential shortcomings and areas of improvement to the design.\nRequirements: Students should have prior experience with Git and Python. Familiarity with basic data analysis techniques is an advantage.\nReferences:\n\n\nEckhardt, P., Ernst, K., Fleischmann, T., Geßler, A., Schnickmann, K., Thurner, L., and Wagner, G. “search-query: An Open-Source Python Library for Academic Search Queries”.\n\n\nGusenbauer, M., & Haddaway, N.

    "text": "Main criteria\nThe process is evaluated according to the following criteria:\n\nSystematicity in managing time, resources, and challenges. Start early to have enough time for each task, ensure that resources such as labs, equipment, participants, partners, or thesis advisors are available at the right time, and reduce potential risks by anticipating them and identifying potential alternatives.\nProactiveness in developing the topic (research question, theory, method, etc.) and incorporating feedback. To receive feedback, you can share (parts of) the thesis with us. We encourage you to challenge our feedback and suggest better alternatives.\nProficiency in leveraging prior research, i.e., identifying relevant papers, achieving an appropriate understanding, assessing contributions critically, and organizing prior work in a persuasive way to clarify how the thesis builds on prior work and how it goes beyond prior work.\n\nThe contribution is evaluated based on several dimensions (based on Leidner, 2020):\n\nExplicitness and significance of research objective or question: Explain how your work builds on prior research, identify related contributions, and clarify the research gap you address. Readers should understand why your research promises interesting insights and who would benefit from it. The editorial of Lange & Pfarrer (2017) provides useful suggestions to accomplish this.\nUniqueness in framing prior research: In summarizing prior research, it is essential to organize existing contributions from the perspective of your work. Prior research, in itself, does not follow a predefined order. It is your responsibility to make sense of the literature and to adopt an organizing frame that helps readers understand how prior research relates to your contribution.\nSystematicity of method: Evaluation criteria and reporting guidelines depend on the method applied. A selection is provided below. In addition to reporting the methodological steps, data and code should be made available with the thesis according to standards of reproducible research. Corresponding methods papers can be found here, and requirements should be discussed with the thesis advisor.\nOriginality of theory: Applies if your contribution involves a theoretical contribution, e.g., in the form of propositions, constructs, or models. Clarify how it differs from related theory and explain why it offers a plausible and more compelling perspective or explanation.\nInterpretation and novelty of findings: The findings should be interpreted appropriately, using a neutral tone, and avoiding overstating or understating their significance. Clearly distinguish findings that confirm prior research or common expectations. Effectively communicate the findings that are novel, interesting, or counterintuitive.\n\nRecommended criteria and reporting guidelines for selected research methods (the equator network provides a comprehensive overview). Additional guidelines can be provided upon request.\n\nThe contribution should be discussed with reference to\n\nThe (methodological) limitations\nThe implications for future research (research gaps)\nThe implications for practice (Ågerfalk & Karlsson, 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote on student ownership and feedback\n\n\n\nStudents are expected to critically engage with feedback provided by thesis advisors while accomplishing the contribution on their own. Especially for top grades (1.0–1.7), simply implementing suggestions is not sufficient. Instead, students are expected to maintain ownership of their work by applying independent judgment and, where appropriate, going beyond or critically reflecting on feedback from thesis advisors.",

Each section has its own scope, as illustrated in the figure below. In the introduction, you can contextualize your work with respect to the broader topic. The methods and findings focus more narrowly on the evidence and results of your work. Afterwards, the discussion should explain how your findings relate to prior research.\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a research paper\n\n\nNote: While creating your thesis, keep the evaluation criteria in mind to ensure your thesis meets the required academic standards.\nAbstract\nThe abstract serves as a point of entry for the reader, providing an initial overview of the research study, including the motivation for the study, the methodological approach employed, and a summary of the main results. In addition, the purpose of the research study should be clearly defined. Typically, an abstract consists of around 300 words.\nIntroduction\nThe introduction should outline the purpose of the study as well as the research question that is sought to be answered. By briefly outlining the context of the study in terms of content and time, the reader acquires a quick overview. A key aspect of the introduction is the presentation of the motivation for conducting the study. This gives the reader a basic understanding of the topic and underpins the relevance and importance of the study. The relevance and purpose can further be highlighted by using an appropriate quotation.\nThe building blocks of Lange and Pfarrer (2017) may be helpful:\n\nCommon ground: Establishing common ground involves presenting the current state of the literature and ensuring that the reader agrees with the basic assumptions, boundary conditions, and key concepts. This step is crucial for gaining the reader’s interest and tacit consent, making them more receptive to the forthcoming arguments and discussions.\nComplication: After establishing common ground, introduce a complication that challenges the current understanding or highlights a gap in the literature. This complication could be a problem, puzzle, or twist that makes the reader realize the inadequacy or incompleteness of the existing academic conversation.\nConcern: To make the complication compelling, explain why it matters. This involves demonstrating the significance of the gap or issue identified. The concern step is about showing the practical and theoretical implications of the complication, emphasizing why it is essential to address this gap in the literature.\nCourse of action: Describe the approach or methodology that will be used to address the identified complication. This could involve developing new constructs, modeling relationships, exploring processes, or synthesizing existing theories. The course of action should be clearly explained, logically structured, and directly aimed at resolving the complication.\nContribution: Finally, articulate how the research will contribute to the academic conversation. This entails explaining the novelty and significance of the findings and how they advance understanding in the field. The contribution should also suggest future theoretical exploration and practical implications for management and organizations.\n\nThe final paragraph of the introduction gives an outline of the structure of the study, that is, the approaches taken in each step of conducting the research study are briefly described. This gives the reader a clear picture of the composition of the study, i.e., what can and cannot be expected of the study.\nBackground\nThis section (which could also be named Literature Review or Conceptual Framework) sets the theoretical and conceptual context of the study and grounds the leading assumptions in theories. This is done by outlining and citing pertinent work. Here, the author can present the acquired background knowledge that is relevant for the following sections of the study. This background knowledge also helps in building the conceptual framework of the study.\nThe literature review should focus on concepts rather than authors and historical development (cf. Webster and Watson, 2002). It is also possible to use a conceptual framework to structure the literature synthesis. Provide precise definitions of those concepts that are central to your work, emphasize concepts rather than authors, and do not include your own judgment in the background section. Use established definitions and concepts and provide a justification when adapting them.\nA graphical representation of the framework helps to illustrate complex theoretical constructs as well as the boundaries of the research study. The explicit statement of the conceptual framework not only informs the reader, but it also guides the author in conducting the research.\nRelevant background literature can be found in journals such as those listed in\n\nthe AIS Senior Scholars’ Basket of Journals\nthe VHB Jourqual Ranking\nor conferences such as ICIS and ECIS.\n\nPapers can be accessed through the Bamberger Katalog, a search on ResearchGate, a search on Google Scholar, or by contacting the authors. For using the Bamberger Katalog, ResearchGate, and some of the Google Scholar papers, you need to be connected to the University of Bamberg VPN.\nGuidelines on searching the literature are provided by Webster and Watson (2002).\nMethodology\nThe methodology section describes a systematic and goal-oriented approach to answer the research question. Hence, the selection of the research method needs to be consistent with the research questions. The approach may be, for example, empirical, analytical, comparative, systematic, historical, or hermeneutic. The methodological approach needs to be described in detail; appropriate reporting standards for the research method should be considered (such as PRISMA for literature reviews); it should be possible to understand the methodological procedures based on the thesis. For example, it is necessary to provide the formulas of regression models.\nResults\nIn this section, the author presents the results of the study. If they are presented by means of figures and/or tables, the results should be clearly legible. Furthermore, in the case of figures, it is recommended to use vector graphics as this ensures good readability without the need to pre-specify the font size within the figures. An example figure and table can be found in the template contained in this repository.\nDiscussion\nIn this section, the author provides a discussion of the results and is thus able to draw an informed conclusion. More precisely, the discussion is an evaluative summary of the research study in relation to the research question. In general, the discussion can be divided into three parts. First, the results should be tied to the research question, thus presenting the reader with a solution or improvement to the identified problem space. Here, for example, the author can draw on empirical findings introduced in the Results section to support their argument. Next, the author should outline the limitations of the research study by critically examining the research approach used. Limitations might comprise, for example, a limited time frame considered in the research study, or the individual refinement of a specific research method due to time constraints. Finally, suggestions for future research avenues should be provided. These suggestions may align with the limitations, as this allows other researchers to build on the present work by extending or analyzing it. In summary, the Discussion section presents the results in relation to the research question as well as restrictions of the study and suggestions for future research in the respective domain.\nConclusion\nThe conclusion contains a summary of the research study. In contrast to the Discussion section, in which the main results are presented, here the key contributions of the work are showcased. A well-crafted conclusion answers the research question stated in the Introduction. By doing so, the author clarifies to what extent the research study has presented a solution or improvement to the examined problem space.\nAcknowledgments and declarations\nIn the acknowledgment section, you may refer to the guideline for the use of digital tools for further information. Additionally, students are advised to consult the ethics page for relevant guidance (although formal ethics approvals cannot be issued for a thesis).\nAppendices\nThe appendices provide supplementary material that supports the content of the thesis but is not essential to the core argument. These materials should be referenced in the main text where appropriate.\nAppendices can be used to provide:\n\nExtended tables or figures\nDetailed methodological procedures\nQuestionnaires or interview guides\nSupplementary analysis or additional results\n\nIn addition, a digital appendix can include elements that support reproducible research objectives. These may be provided as part of the thesis (Git/GitHub) repository, including:\n\nData collected or reused for the study\nCode (e.g., data processing and/or analysis scripts)\nREADME file that explains the structure, usage, and dependencies of the repository\n\nThe digital appendix (repository) can also include the written thesis. It is not necessary to create a separate data repository.\nDeclaration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDo not forget that the last page of your thesis has to be the statutory declaration (“Eidestattliche Erklärung”) of the examination office. This declaration is printed on your topic confirmation.",

Schon zu Beginn gab es mehrere spannende Themen zur Auswahl, sodass ich ein Thema finden konnte, das mich wirklich interessiert. Die flexible Terminbuchung über Calendly war für mich ein riesiger Pluspunkt. Ich konnte unkompliziert Termine vereinbaren und habe immer schnell Antworten auf meine Fragen bekommen. Jede Frage wurde ernst genommen und ausführlich beantwortet. Der gesamte Betreuungsprozess war klar strukturiert, was mir enorm geholfen hat. Alle wichtigen Informationen zu den einzelnen Schritten, den Anforderungen und den Bewertungskriterien waren transparent auf der Webseite des Lehrstuhls dargestellt. Dadurch wusste ich immer genau, worauf es ankommt und was als Nächstes zu tun ist. Besonders hilfreich war auch, dass Prof. Dr. Wagner mir gezielt passende wissenschaftliche Literatur zugeschickt hat. Das hat nicht nur mein Schreiben erleichtert, sondern auch mein Verständnis für das Thema vertieft. Insgesamt war die Betreuung durch Prof. Dr. Wagner hervorragend. Die klare Struktur, die schnelle und hilfreiche Kommunikation sowie die wertvollen inhaltlichen Impulse haben meine Arbeit enorm bereichert. Ich kann den Lehrstuhl Digital Work uneingeschränkt empfehlen und würde jederzeit wieder eine Arbeit dort schreiben! Bewertung: 5/5\n\nIch kann das Verfassen einer Abschlussarbeit am Lehrstuhl Digital Work bei Prof. Wagner vollstens empfehlen. Mein Thema war sehr spannend und an das Projekt, das ich im vorherigen Semester an dem Lehrstul belegt hatte, angeknüpft. Dank der bereitgestellten Startliteratur und einer kurzen Einführung im Rahmen eines Kick-off-Meetings durch Prof. Wagner fiel mir der Einstieg in das Thema leicht. Der Arbeitsprozess und hilfreiche Tipps zu den einzelnen Schritten sowie die Evaluationskriterien wurden klar geschildert und waren online verfügbar. Besonders geschätzt habe ich das häufige und konstruktive Feedback von Prof. Wagner. Das Buchen von Zeitslots über Calendly machte die Terminfindung unkompliziert – Prof. Wagner war immer zuverlässig erreichbar und hat sich viel Zeit für meine Fragen genommen. Zudem hatte Prof. Wagner einen Review-Prozess mit drei anderen Studierenden mit ähnlichen Themen organisiert, durch welchen ich zusätzlich wertvolles Feedback erhalten konnte. Insgesamt war die Betreuung hervorragend.\nBewertung: 5/5\n\nDie Betreuung meiner Bachelorarbeit durch Herrn Prof. Wagner war durchweg positiv. Die Arbeit konnte vollständig remote verfasst werden, wobei regelmäßige und hilfreiche Online-Meetings den Austausch ermöglichten. Die Themenfindung verlief relativ unkompliziert, da bereits einige offene Themen zur Auswahl standen. In einem kurzen Bewerbungsgespräch und dem anschließenden Kick-off-Meeting erhielt ich wertvolle Einblicke sowie erste Literaturhinweise zum Thema, sowie der Methodik, die den Einstieg erleichterten. Fragen und Feedback konnten unkompliziert über Calendly-Termine geklärt werden. Dabei wurde auf Probleme schnell und kompetent eingegangen, und eigene Ideen konnten eingebracht und diskutiert werden. Die Bewertungskriterien waren transparent und wurden auch im finalen Feedback-Gespräch nachvollziehbar angewendet und erklärt.\nFazit: Ich kann die Betreuung bei Herrn Prof. Wagner uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen.\nBewertung: 5/5\n\nMeine Abschlussarbeit am Lehrstuhl von Herrn Wagner zu schreiben war sehr angenehm. Termine für Feedbackgespräche können per Online-Tool ganz einfach ausgemacht werden, Herr Wagner ist auch sehr oft verfügbar, selbst kurzfristige Terminabsagen waren kein Problem. Die vielen Feedbackgespräche haben mir die Gelegenheit gegeben, viele (auch mal weniger sinnvolle) Fragen zu stellen, die Herr Wagner immer sehr freundlich und respektvoll beantwortete - die Kommunikation fand generell komplett auf Augenhöhe statt. Dieses Feedback war in der anfänglichen, schwierigen Phase besonders wertvoll, in der noch Fokus und Methodik der Arbeit festgelegt werden mussten. Herr Wagner hatte außerdem immer eine Menge hilfreicher und relevanter Paper zur Hand, die mir sehr geholfen haben. Die Bewertung meiner Arbeit war fair, transparent und nachvollziehbar und wurde mir von Herrn Wagner im abschließenden Gespräch ausführlich erklärt. Alles in allem kann ich jeder und jedem nur wärmstens empfehlen, Abschlussarbeiten bei Herrn Wagner zu schreiben.\nBewertung: 5/5\n\nDie Betreuung meiner Bachelorarbeit durch Professor Wagner war von Anfang an ausgezeichnet. Er zeigte sich unterstützend und offen bei der Themenfindung und meinem Interessensgebiet, was mir den Einstieg in die Arbeit erleichterte.\nBesonders hilfreich waren die regelmäßigen Feedback-Gespräche, die sowohl am Anfang beim Brainstorming für mögliche Vorgehensweisen als auch während des gesamten Prozesses stattfanden. Professor Wagner nahm sich immer die Zeit, meine Vorschläge anzuhören, und gab konstruktives Feedback, sei es zur Umsetzbarkeit meiner Ideen oder zu Punkten, die ich weiter vertiefen sollte.\nAuch die von ihm bereitgestellten Unterlagen zur Methodik waren äußerst nützlich und halfen mir, die Arbeit fundiert und strukturiert aufzubauen. Zudem empfahl er mir bei Bedarf relevante wissenschaftliche Papers, die meinen Forschungsprozess bereicherten.\nIm Großen und Ganzen fand ich die Betreuung durch Professor Wagner sehr gut. Ich hätte nicht gedacht, dass ich so viel Freude am Erstellungsprozess meiner Bachelorarbeit haben würde, aber genau das war der Fall. Deshalb kann ich es jedem nur empfehlen, die Seminar- oder Abschlussarbeit bei ihm zu schreiben.\nBewertung: 5/5\n\nDas Verfassen meiner Bachelorarbeit am Lehrstuhl Digital Work war sehr angenehm. Prof. Wagner hat mich von Anfang an, vom Prozess der Themenfindung bis hin zum tatsächlichen Schreiben der Arbeit, aktiv unterstützt und gut beraten. Betreuungstermine zu vereinbaren, war mithilfe des Tools Calendly sehr einfach und transparent. Durch das Tool wusste man immer, wann Prof. Wagner für Termine verfügbar war, und konnte so die eigenen Termine zeitlich gut vorausplanen, ohne wie üblich durch einen langwierigen E-Mail-Verkehr einen gemeinsamen Termin mit dem Professor finden zu müssen. Hervorzuheben ist auch, dass Herr Wagner in dringenden Fällen Termine angeboten hat, selbst wenn keine mehr in Calendly verfügbar waren. Zu den Terminen war Herr Wagner immer bestens mit dem aktuellen Stand der Arbeit vertraut und konnte hilfreiche Tipps und Anregungen geben (z. B. Papers, die für die Arbeit nützlich sein könnten). Auf meine Fragen wurde sehr verständlich und genau eingegangen, sodass ich immer genau wusste, was als Nächstes zu tun ist. Insgesamt konnte ich durch die Bachelorarbeit mein Wissen im Bereich generativer KI vertiefen und hatte auch Spaß am Erstellungsprozess der Arbeit (was ich vorher nicht für möglich gehalten hätte). Ich kann es somit jedem nur empfehlen, die Seminar- oder Abschlussarbeit bei Prof. Wagner zu schreiben.\nBewertung: 5/5\n\nDas Schreiben meiner Bachelorarbeit bei Prof. Wagner hat mir insgesamt sehr gut gefallen. Ich hatte im Semester davor schon das Digital Work Projekt belegt und mich dann für eine Bachelorarbeit im Bereich des colrev Projekts interessiert. Obwohl ich wenig Ahnung hatte, worüber genau ich eigentlich schreiben wollte konnte Prof. Wagner mich schnell für mein Thema begeistern. Besonders hilfreich fand ich die Erreichbarkeit und die angenehme Atmosphäre bei der Betreuung. Über ein bereitgestelltes Tool konnte man ganz einfach online Termine ausmachen ohne dabei direkt ewig viele Emails zur Terminfindung hin und herschicken zu müssen. Generell konnte ich mich mit allen meinen (sicherlich auch manchmal unnötigen oder weniger schlauen) Fragen an Prof. Wagner wenden und wurde immer wertschätzend und geduldig behandelt, das ist sicherlich nicht selbstverständlich. Ein anderer Aspekt der mir gut gefallen hat war der praktische Teil meiner Arbeit. Durch den Programmierteil hatte man immer wieder neue Herausforderungen und eine willkommene Abwechslung vom reinen Literatur lesen und wiedergeben. Besonders freut mich, dass mein erarbeitetes Tool einen tatsächlichen Nutzen hat und in der Lehre weiterverwendet werden soll! Das hilft auf jeden Fall beim Schreiben der Arbeit motiviert zu bleiben. Insgesamt kann ich es uneingeschränkt weiterempfehlen beim Lehrstuhl Digital Work und Herrn Prof. Wagner eine Bachelorarbeit zu schreiben. Ich hätte es mir nicht besser vorstellen können.\nBewertung: 5/5\n\nEs war eine äußerst bereichernde Erfahrung, meine Bachelorarbeit am Lehrstuhl Digital Work unter der fachkundigen Anleitung von Prof. Dr. Wagner zu verfassen. Herr Wagner begleitete die gesamte Entwicklung meines Projekts und stand stets zur Verfügung, um wertvolle Ratschläge und Optimierungsvorschläge zu geben. Sein Engagement und seine Bereitschaft, bei der Weiterentwicklung meiner Arbeit zu unterstützen, haben meine Forschung und mein Verständnis des Themas wesentlich verbessert.\nBesonders hilfreich war die umfangreiche Literatur, die sowohl aufsteigende als auch relevante Literatur umfasste, die mir seit Beginn meiner Arbeit zur Verfügung gestellt wurde. Diese umfassende Quellenbasis hat es mir ermöglicht, mein Thema gründlich zu vertiefen und einen fundierten theoretischen Hintergrund für meine Untersuchung zu schaffen.\nInsgesamt war es eine Freude, meine Abschlussarbeit am Lehrstuhl Digital Work zu verfassen. Die Unterstützung und die Ressourcen, die mir zur Verfügung gestellt wurden, haben meine akademische Erfahrung bereichert und meine Fähigkeiten weiterentwickelt. Ich bin dankbar für die Gelegenheit, unter der Anleitung von Prof. Dr. Wagner zu arbeiten und freue mich darauf, das Gelernte in meiner zukünftigen akademischen und beruflichen Laufbahn anzuwenden.\nBewertung: 4.9/5\n\nDas Schreiben meiner Bachelorarbeit bei Prof. Dr. Wagner am Digital Work Lehrstuhl war insgesamt wirklich super. Gleich zu Beginn konnte ich zwischen verschiedenen Themen auswählen und mir ein für mich spannendes aussuchen. Was mir dann am besten gefallen hat war, dass mir sowohl bei der weiteren Entwicklung des Themas als auch während des Schreibprozesses viel Freiheit gelassen wurde in welche Richtung ich die Bachelorarbeit inhaltlich lenken möchte bzw. auch aktiv von Prof. Dr. Wagner dabei unterstützt und ermutig wurde. Gleichzeitig habe ich bei Fragen oder Unklarheiten schnell entweder per Mail oder per Termin Feedback bekommen können und auch immer wieder interessanten Input (z.B. aufschlussreiche Paper) von Prof. Dr. Wagner erhalten. Für mich persönlich war es auch wichtig, dass ich viel lernen konnte (vor allem über Machine Learning), die Möglichkeit hatte praktisch zu programmieren und auch das Gefühl hatte, dass meine Arbeit und Ergebnisse nicht nur für die Schublade sind, sondern wirklich einen Nutzen haben. Deswegen habe ich alles im allen nichts auszusetzen und kann Prof. Dr. Wagner und den Digital Work Lehrstuhl allen bedenkenlos weiterempfehlen, die bei super Betreuung und spannenden Thematiken viel lernen und mitnehmen möchten.\nBewertung: 5/5",
